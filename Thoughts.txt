1) Wanted to learn Deep Forest ML Algorithm, but to do that, had to have prior knowledge about a decision tree as well. 
-I didn't know what a decision tree was, so had to understand that as well

2) Random Forest is just a bunch of decision trees. The products of those decision trees are taken into majority vote, and those are the final decision of the whole RandomForest.
